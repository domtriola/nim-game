# Nim Game #

Nim is a game where players alternate taking any number of tokens from one row
at a time. This is a misere version, meaning the player to take the last token
loses.

The computer AI uses the [mathematical theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nim#Mathematical_theory) behind Nim to
play perfectly (when winning moves are available to it).
